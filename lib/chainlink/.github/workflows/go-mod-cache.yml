name: Go Module Cache

# This workflow is responsible for updating the Go Module Cache.
# It will maintain the cache: linux-gomod-1-<hash>
# All other workflows should only restore this cache.

# This workflow is useful because it will:
# 1. Create the cache if it doesn't exist
#   - This can be a problem when multiple jobs load the same cache.
#     Only one will get priority to create the cache.
# 2. Should not fail, therefore creating a cache
#   - When a Job errors/fails it will not upload a new cache.
#     So when test/build jobs are responsible for creating the new cache,
#     they can fail causing cache misses on subsequent runs. Even though
#     the dependencies haven't changed.
